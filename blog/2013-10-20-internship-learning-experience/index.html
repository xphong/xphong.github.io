<p>I had just recently completed my 8 week internship as a Web Developer. It was an amazing learning experience so I figure why not write about it.</p>

<h2 id="the-job-search">The Job Search</h2>

<p>After graduating, I felt that my skills were &#8216;good enough&#8217; to seek a full-time or contract job. I was applying for jobs for about a month, I got a couple of interviews/coding tests and one company really boosted my morale by saying only 10% pass their coding test (still skeptical but positivity was what I needed at that point). However, there wasn&#8217;t much luck so I decided to apply for internships.</p>

<p>I found an intern position at a company called Dashboard on Humber College&#8217;s co-op website (would never thought I would be using that website). The interview was quite interesting, I met with the two Directors of Technology and I had expected a technical interview but instead I was bombed with some difficult questions. They told me that they were just testing my skill level, but these questions were harder than the questions I was asked during an interview for a full-time position. I was actually sweating because of the heat that day&#8230; totally not because I struggled so hard haha. Anyway, at the end of the interview they had offer me the internship position, even though I thought I bombed that interview. I accepted it instantly because it would be awesome to learn from these guys.</p>

<h2 id="a-learning-experience">A Learning Experience</h2>

<p>The first project I got put on was a redesign of The Toronto Santa Claus Parade website. They had design comps built out for a few of the pages and they asked me to create the static HTML/CSS pages. This was incredibly overwhelming because it was the first week of my internship and they got me on a pretty big project. The Toronto Santa Claus Parade website gets over a hundred thousand unique visits during the month of the parade. Their development pattern included using Foundation with Compass which I had no experience with, I didn&#8217;t even know what Compass was. After doing some research, I found out that Compass is just a Sass extension/framework that helps compile and write Sass stylesheets. In addition, Compass has a large collection of mixins and functions you can use with Sass.</p>

<div class="tagline">
  <h3>
    My first week was basically just me learning how to learn and adapt to the team&#8217;s work pattern.
  </h3>
</div>

<p>Learning how the Ruby Installer and how gems work was first on the list, I am a PC person so everything was done using the Command Line. Next was learning how to create the project structure, luckily for me Zurb Foundation has got some pretty good docs.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">[sudo] gem install compass
cd path/to/where-you-want-your-project
run compass create &lt;project-name&gt; -r zurb-foundation --using foundation
</pre>

<p>Creating the pages was easy because I had created HTML/CSS pages from PSDs before. I ran into a couple of styling problems mainly because of the way I coded.</p>

<h3 id="help">Help!</h3>

<p>One of the fun things about running into problems is learning how to fix it. However, when I got really stuck (meaning I could not Google my way out), I had to asked one of the directors to help me which turned out to be a pretty awesome experience. The director sat down with me to run through the problem and find a way to fix it. There was some constructive criticism, he had told me that my code was repetitive so I read a couple of articles on DRY (Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself) code and started to properly use mix-ins and variables in my CSS.</p>

<p>I am not saying to always ask for help and I am not saying to never ask for help, but you could spend half an hour trying to solve something or the person across from you could help you out in 5 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="note-taking">Note Taking</h3>

<p>Another thing I learned is that note taking is extremely important and useful. During my internship I wrote everything that I had learned down which is why I am able to write this post with so much detail. It also helps to go back and read your notes to refresh your memory of things.</p>

<h3 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h3>

<p>Your skills should never be &#8216;good enough&#8217;. Internship is pretty cool, you will learn and experience lots.</p>
