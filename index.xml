      <description>How our team did it in 4 easy steps Originally published at https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-end-to-end-testing-is-important-for-your-team-cb7eb0ec1504
At Hubba, our business needs are always evolving and the development speed needs to catch up with it. One of the ways to keep the team moving forward without breaking everything is End-to-end Testing (E2E). Having a full test suite with E2E tests allows us to move quickly. It allows developers to push code without the worry of breaking things.</description>

TL;DR — This article will show you how to get quickly started with Vue and Vuex. In addition to grabbing data from an API and displaying it. We will be building a simple application that searches the Marvel database for characters then displays the results. What is Vue?   Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces.</description>

REACT
SLIDE DECK
  This is based on a lunch and learn presentation that I created, comparing Angular and React. First, I will be going through legacy vs future applications as the purpose of the presentation was to talk about the existing issues of the current application (written in AngularJS) and to provide knowledge around the newer frameworks/libraries.  Legacy Front End   Hard to Reuse Across Projects and Teams   A big issue with having a legacy front end is that it is hard to reuse across projects and teams.</description>

      <description>When I started learning React Redux and creating side projects with it, I found it very hard to find a minimal starter/boilerplate package to start with. Picking and learning new tools can be difficult, especially in the current JavaScript ecosystem. The big reason to why I had trouble finding a starter was because a lot of the starter packages had a lot of boilerplate code that I did not want. I was looking for a pure front end application with routing and an API call that I could use as reference or as an example.</description>

      <description>In my last blog post A Web Developer&amp;#8217;s Transition From School to the Workplace I wrote that as a web developer, you should never stop learning and growing. I joined a new company a bit over a year ago and in the past year I have learned a lot, specifically about unit testing code. This is because on our projects, unit tests are required for a user story to be closed.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s tough learning a new technology because you have no idea where to start, so you end up procrastinating and saying that you will learn it later or &amp;#8220;tomorrow&amp;#8221; and then it never happens. This still happens to me, but I have found a solution! The best way to learn a new library or framework is to use it on an existing project or use it on a new project.</description>

      <description>I had just recently completed my 8 week internship as a Web Developer. It was an amazing learning experience so I figure why not write about it.
The Job Search After graduating, I felt that my skills were &amp;#8216;good enough&amp;#8217; to seek a full-time or contract job. I was applying for jobs for about a month, I got a couple of interviews/coding tests and one company really boosted my morale by saying only 10% pass their coding test (still skeptical but positivity was what I needed at that point).</description>

VISUAL STUDIO 2010 ULTIMATE VERSION OR PREMIUM VERSION Most articles tend to leave this part out, this is a pain because you will open up your Visual Studio and wonder where the option is. Other versions of Visual Studio (2012, professional) do not have this tool installed.</description>

      <description>New Layout You may have noticed that the layout of the website has changed. I wanted to switch to a layout that is new and responsive because the number of mobile users is gradually increasing. I was actually afraid, at first, to switch to a new layout because I was worried that my site would break and I would have to go back and fix everything up. After doing some research about changing layouts (thank you Google), I found out that it is quite easy to make the switch.</description>

      <description>Web Fonts In my PHP group project I have been given the role of being the designer for the interface of the website. Since we are using CSS3 I decided that using font-face will help with the design, and it did, tremendously.
Here is the first version of the interface:

Now here is the redesign using web fonts (Actual link &amp;#8211; http://shopright.phonghuynh.ca):

      <description>Have you ever had that little error that messed up your whole project? Back in programming, I remember when I used to miss variable names and the program would not run. However, Java would tell you exactly where the error is. This week I was working on my second assignment for Digital Design, which requires me to code my mock-up website from assignment 1 into html/css. I made the mistake of putting a pretty looking slider in the mock-up because I did not know this assignment was coming&amp;#8230; So for the website I had to use a jQuery slider plugin for my slider.</description>

      <description>ASP.NET The assignment asked to make two separate .aspx pages. The first page uses a data bound control loaded with information from a table in the database. When the user clicks on the data, it essentially loads the full details of the selected data. The second page uses templates to allow for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE for the table. I spent all day googling how to create a button that dynamically loads another data bound control without using the autogenerate button.</description>

I was working on an assignment for my Digital Design class where I had to build a series of mock up web pages. The requested size was to fit the standard 1024 pixel screen width, but when I was working on it I had it at 960 pixel width.
When I realized that I had it at the wrong width I had already finished a couple of pages.</description>

      <description>After finally getting my website uploaded I realized that it was no where to be found on Google search. Achieving a high rank on a search engine like Google is very important because that is how people find you. Search engines are also known as the best source for traffic because everyone uses it.
So to get on Google search I registered for Webmasters Tools and Analytics which requires you to put an XML sitemap and a script of code into your website so that you can appear on Google&amp;#8217;s index in order to get searched.</description>

      <description>A problem I had while implementing the “flyweight” design pattern for a lab in my design patterns class. The flyweight design pattern basically has a factory to hold different attributes for example, the attributes of a font which are:   &amp;#8211; Font: String
&amp;#8211; Size: Integer
&amp;#8211; Color: String
&amp;#8211; Italic: boolean
&amp;#8211; Bold: Boolean
&amp;#8211; Row: Integer
&amp;#8211; Column: Integer  To implement the design pattern we must add different fonts to the factory, only if the font is not already in the factory.</description>

      <description>When working with servlets and java server pages, you need a web application deployment descriptor.
It is basically an XML file (usually called web.xml or application.xml) that tells the container about the web application.
It contains:
ServletContext initialization parameters
Servlet/JSP definitions
Servlet/JSP mappings
Welcome file list
Error pages
Problem:
JSP/Servlet page outputs a descriptor error.
Impact:
Your webpage will not run without a deployment descriptor
Solution:
Add the deployment descriptor to the project.</description>

      <description>My name is Phong Huynh, and I am a Web Developer in Toronto, Canada. I have a Postgraduate Certificate in Web Development and a diploma in Computer Programming, both with honours standing.
At the young age of 13 I learned and taught myself how to use Adobe Photoshop 7 using online tutorials and videos. Using my self-taught skills I manipulated images to use as signature tags on forums and other various websites.</description>
