      <description>The main purpose of this website was to create my programming portfolio and get it online.
Having a portfolio is extremely important when you are a computer programmer because it is a good way to showcase and explain your work. In addition, having a portfolio ready can put you ahead of many other candidates when looking for a job.</description>

      <description>An assignment for my Web Application Development class. For this assignment I had to create two forms that both use validation groups to validate the fields. One of the forms must use either Wizard Steps or Multiview. I chose Wizard Steps.
Problem:
Validation was not working for the wizard steps even though everything was coded perfectly.
&amp;lt;asp:WizardStep id=”wds_2″ runat=”server” title=”Account Info”&amp;gt; &amp;lt;asp:Label ID=”lbl_username” runat=”server” Text=”Username: ” AssociatedControlID=”txt_username” /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;asp:TextBox ID=”txt_username” runat=”server” /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;asp:RequiredFieldValidator ID=”rfv_username” runat=”server” ControlToValidate=”txt_username” display=”Dynamic” Text=”Empty value” ErrorMessage=”Please enter username.</description>

      <description>After finally getting my website uploaded I realized that it was no where to be found on Google search. Achieving a high rank on a search engine like Google is very important because that is how people find you. Search engines are also known as the best source for traffic because everyone uses it.
So to get on Google search I registered for Webmasters Tools and Analytics which requires you to put an XML sitemap and a script of code into your website so that you can appear on Google&amp;#8217;s index in order to get searched.</description>

      <description>This is an assignment question I had for my Design Patterns and Software Testing class.
Problem: 
You are given a project that is going to be used in a high school with 400 students. The application will store the student specifications along with the courses they take and corresponding marks into a database and applies some calculations for each student and each class. For example, the average of the marks of a specific course in a class, the number of failed students in a subject in a class, etc.</description>

&amp;nbsp;
Problem:
Car model website does not receive check box list items for drop down list items other than the first item.</description>

      <description>When working with servlets and java server pages, you need a web application deployment descriptor.
It is basically an XML file (usually called web.xml or application.xml) that tells the container about the web application.
It contains:
ServletContext initialization parameters
Servlet/JSP definitions
Servlet/JSP mappings
Welcome file list
Error pages
Problem:
JSP/Servlet page outputs a descriptor error.
Impact:
Your webpage will not run without a deployment descriptor
Solution:
Add the deployment descriptor to the project.</description>

      <description> Unix Assignment problem for Operating Systems class        Problem:    Display the calendar for the winter season (November, December, January, February, March and    April).      Impact:    The calendar dates need to be displayed at the same time    &amp;nbsp;    Solution:    cal -3 12 2012 | cal -3 3 2012    does not work because piping will cause the calendar to only show the January to april months    &amp;nbsp;    cal -3 12 2012 ; cal -3 3 2012    works because it inputs both the commands into the system which shows all of the calendar months for the winter season    </description>
