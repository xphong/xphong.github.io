      <description>New Layout You may have noticed that the layout of the website has changed. I wanted to switch to a layout that is new and responsive because the number of mobile users is gradually increasing. I was actually afraid, at first, to switch to a new layout because I was worried that my site would break and I would have to go back and fix everything up. After doing some research about changing layouts (thank you Google), I found out that it is quite easy to make the switch.</description>
