      <description>It&amp;#8217;s tough learning a new technology because you have no idea where to start, so you end up procrastinating and saying that you will learn it later or &amp;#8220;tomorrow&amp;#8221; and then it never happens. This still happens to me, but I have found a solution! The best way to learn a new library or framework is to use it on an existing project or use it on a new project.</description>

      <description>I had just recently completed my 8 week internship as a Web Developer. It was an amazing learning experience so I figure why not write about it.
The Job Search After graduating, I felt that my skills were &amp;#8216;good enough&amp;#8217; to seek a full-time or contract job. I was applying for jobs for about a month, I got a couple of interviews/coding tests and one company really boosted my morale by saying only 10% pass their coding test (still skeptical but positivity was what I needed at that point).</description>
