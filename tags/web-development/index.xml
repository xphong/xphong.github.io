      <title>Simple React Redux Starter Guide / Documentation</title>

      <description>When I started learning React Redux and creating side projects with it, I found it very hard to find a minimal starter/boilerplate package to start with. Picking and learning new tools can be difficult, especially in the current JavaScript ecosystem. The big reason to why I had trouble finding a starter was because a lot of the starter packages had a lot of boilerplate code that I did not want. I was looking for a pure front end application with routing and an API call that I could use as reference or as an example.</description>

      <description>It has been around a year since I graduated and I can still remember how anxious I was about going into the workplace. After nearly a year of working in the industry, I feel that sharing my experiences will be helpful to those currently transitioning from school to the workplace.
Table of Contents  Background School Portfolio and Job Searching Interview Process The Future and Continuous Learning  Background A little bit about me: I interned as a junior web developer at an agency for a couple of months, got a full-time job at that same agency, and now I am currently working at a startup/software company.</description>

      <description>New Layout You may have noticed that the layout of the website has changed. I wanted to switch to a layout that is new and responsive because the number of mobile users is gradually increasing. I was actually afraid, at first, to switch to a new layout because I was worried that my site would break and I would have to go back and fix everything up. After doing some research about changing layouts (thank you Google), I found out that it is quite easy to make the switch.</description>

      <description>Web Fonts In my PHP group project I have been given the role of being the designer for the interface of the website. Since we are using CSS3 I decided that using font-face will help with the design, and it did, tremendously.
Here is the first version of the interface:

Now here is the redesign using web fonts (Actual link &amp;#8211; http://shopright.phonghuynh.ca):

Also with some colour changes but we are talking about fonts here.</description>

      <description>Have you ever had that little error that messed up your whole project? Back in programming, I remember when I used to miss variable names and the program would not run. However, Java would tell you exactly where the error is. This week I was working on my second assignment for Digital Design, which requires me to code my mock-up website from assignment 1 into html/css. I made the mistake of putting a pretty looking slider in the mock-up because I did not know this assignment was coming&amp;#8230; So for the website I had to use a jQuery slider plugin for my slider.</description>

      <description>ASP.NET The assignment asked to make two separate .aspx pages. The first page uses a data bound control loaded with information from a table in the database. When the user clicks on the data, it essentially loads the full details of the selected data. The second page uses templates to allow for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE for the table. I spent all day googling how to create a button that dynamically loads another data bound control without using the autogenerate button.</description>
