      <description>When I started learning React Redux and creating side projects with it, I found it very hard to find a minimal starter/boilerplate package to start with. Picking and learning new tools can be difficult, especially in the current JavaScript ecosystem.

I was looking for a pure front end application with routing and an API call that I could use as reference or as an example.</description>
